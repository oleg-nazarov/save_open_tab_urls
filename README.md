# Save Open Tab URLs
*Google Chrome 89+*

## Why to use this extension
Save open tab URLs into local `<file.txt>` and reopen them:
- on another PC
- on the same PC under another OS
- when they've been lost

#### Supports
- multiple windows
- tab groups
- pinned tabs

## How to use
1. (Soon: Chrome Web Store)

2. Manually:
- download the latest release archive and unzip it
- in Google Chrome type `chrome://extensions/`
- press "Developer mode" switcher to have it turned on
- press "Load unpacked" button and choose the unzipped directory with the `manifest.json` file inside
- enjoy

## Next plans:
- on error, while reading a certain tab, continue reading others but show a warning for a user that he should do something about corrupted lines
- optionally save incognito tabs
- optionally save tabs only of the current window
- show how many tab URLs will be saved and the titles
- add optional encryption for downloaded URLs
- save not into a local file but on the server
    - login via google account
    - each opened and closed tab creates a history, so if you unexpectedly lost all your tabs you can reopen them using the extension
