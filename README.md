# Save Open Tab URLs
*Google Chrome web browser*

## Why to use this extension
Save open tab URLs and re-open them
- on another PC
- on the same PC but another OS
- when they've lost

## Features
- write all open tab URLs into local `<file.txt>`
- using `<file.txt>`, re-open all tabs

## Next plans:
- support tabs in groups
- add encryption to protect URLs from the reading by other people's eyes (maybe use binary; however, binary is still not safe)
- save not into a local file but on the server
    - login via google account
    - each opened and closed tab creates a history, so if you unexpectedly lost all your tabs you can re-open them using the extension
