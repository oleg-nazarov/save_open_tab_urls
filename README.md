# Save Open Tab URLs
*Google Chrome 89+*

## Why to use this extension
Save open tab URLs into local `<file.txt>` and reopen them:
- on another PC
- on the same PC under another OS
- when they've lost

#### Supports
- multiple windows
- pinned tabs
- tab groups

## How to use
1. (Soon: visit Chrome Web Store)

2. Manually:
- download the `.zip` archive and unzip it
- in Google Chrome browser go to `chrome://extensions/`
- press "Developer mode" switcher to have it turned on
- press "Load unpacked" button and choose the unzipped directory
- enjoy!

## Next plans:
- on error, while reading a certain tab, continue reading others but show a warning for a user that he could do something about corrupted lines
- optionally save incognito tabs
- optionally save tabs only of the current window
- show how many tab URLs will be saved and the titles
- add optional encryption to protect URLs from the reading by other people's eyes (maybe use binary; however, binary is still not safe)
- save not into a local file but on the server
    - login via google account
    - each opened and closed tab creates a history, so if you unexpectedly lost all your tabs you can reopen them using the extension
