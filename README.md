# Save Open Tab URLs
*Google Chrome web browser*

## Why to use this extension
Save open tab URLs and reopen them
- on another PC
- on the same PC but another OS
- when they've lost

## Features
- save all open tab URLs into local `<file.txt>`
- using `<file.txt>`, reopen all tabs

## Next plans:
- optionally save tabs only of the current window
- show how many tab URLs will be saved and the titles
- support tabs in groups
- add optional encryption to protect URLs from the reading by other people's eyes (maybe use binary; however, binary is still not safe)
- save not into a local file but on the server
    - login via google account
    - each opened and closed tab creates a history, so if you unexpectedly lost all your tabs you can reopen them using the extension
